# Simple Automation Script using Ruby
Welcome! I'm sure you found this particular repo by chance but nevertheless, welcome to my humble first GitHub repo.

Not much to be seen here. I'm just using this particular repo for my test automation training.
Feel free to clone this repo if you're interested!

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you already have Gems installed on your machine. You can download on [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download)
2. Install [RUBY](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/). I'm using 2.5.3

### Installation

First and foremost, this is my first time creating installation tutorial so apologize on any mistake

1. You need Selenium Webdriver, Test-Unit and Firefox GeckoDriver which fortunately, can be easily installed using GEMS. You can use the script below
```
gem install selenium-webdriver
gem install geckodriver-helper
gem install test-unit
```
No specific version needed as far as I know, this is just a simple script after all

2. Run **Main.rb** on your cmd to run all the test cases.
```
ruby Main.rb
```
